# Advent of Code
Fun puzzles to warm my brain up for learning. Also, where I record my thought process.

[First puzzle](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) was a nice introductory puzzle.
- I can calculate the sum of any elf I come across first; store that somewhere temporarily and replace the sum (after a blank) if it is larger than my previous sum value. If it is not larger, continue on to the next elf for sum of calories for the next elf.
